  <h1 id="code-of-conduct-for-ices-nepal">Code of Conduct for ICES Nepal</h1>
<p>The purpose of our code of conduct is to ensure that the participants can attend and have the best experience while feeling as a part of the community. We are all here to learn and share what we know while having a good time.</p>
<p>The ICES community Code of Conduct covers our behaviour as the members of the ICES community, in any forum, code repository, website, private correspondence or public meetings and events.</p>
<p>As a community with diverse group of members, there can be communication issues and unhappiness among the members. To help resolve these issues, we have established some ground rules that we expect the members to follow to make the ICES community a great place to learn, share and collaborate.</p>
<p>The following list includes most, but not all, rules that are to be followed in spirit to make it easier for everyone to feel inclusive and be excellent to each other.</p>
<h2 id="be-nice-to-everyone.">1. Be nice to everyone.</h2>
<p>Everyone in the ICES community should feel welcome, regardless of their background. They should be able to attend any events without discrimination and should be able to speak freely within the community.</p>
<h2 id="respect-the-members.">2. Respect the members.</h2>
<p>Please be polite and respectful to fellow community members. No offensive comments related to age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, race, personal views, physical or mental disabilities; no sexual images in public spaces, real or implied violence, intimidation, stalking, harrasment, sustained disruption of talks, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention will not be tolerated. Being a community with diverse group of members, there can be disagreements and misunderstandings but they cannot be an excuse for poor behaviour. Any misunderstanding and disagreements are to be resolved within the community with a calm headed talk, instead of personally attacking the community members.</p>
<h2 id="communicate-effectively-within-the-community.">3. Communicate effectively within the community.</h2>
<p>Communicating effectively and clearly can help avoid misunderstandings in the community. Everyone can have a different perspective and interpretation of words depending on our backgrounds. So, clear and effective communication can help bring our community closer. It is always better to ask for clarification than to make assumptions. All the members can easily contact us with the contact information below to provide us their feedback.</p>
<h2 id="ask-for-help-from-the-community.">4. Ask for help from the community.</h2>
<p>All the members are free to ask for any type of help from the community including, but not limited to, technical, educational and personal problems. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged.</p>
<p>In addition to this Code of Conduct, all ICES community members are governed by the following policy. All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers, including the event organizing team, are required to follow the following policy.</p>
<h2 id="policy">Policy</h2>
<p>Harrasment includes offensive comments relateed to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. Sponsors, event organizing staff and other volunteer organizers should not use sexualized images, activities, clothing/uniforms, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including expulsion from the event.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, Please contact the organizing committee using the contact information below this policy.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all of our event venues and event-related social events.</p>
<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting icesnepal@gmail.com, or directly to any members of the ICES executive committee or the event organizing committee. As a community, we want our community to be healthy and want to ensure everyone has a good experience, so please contact us at icesnepal@gmail.com if there is an issue so we can help address it.</p>
<p><strong>This document is subject to change according to the changing requirements of the community.</strong></p>
